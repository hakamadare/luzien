# Luzien

[Morpheuz](http://www.morpheuz.net/) is a sleep tracker that uses the [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) smartwatch as a sensor.

While the smartphone component of Morpheuz provides a graph of the most recent night's sleep, it doesn't provide any functionality for storing sleep data over time.  The only data export function it provides is the ability to email the current night's sleep via the smartphone's email client.  Luzien will consist of the following software components:

1. A collection of Perl modules providing the ability to store and retrieve sleep data.
2. A lightweight server exposing a RESTful API to these modules.
3. One or more clients for the server.

Luzien is a work in progress; watch this space as the project progresses.
